# bridge-failure-load-calculator

This MATLAB script calculates the factor of safety for various bridge designs given a load of 400 N. It creates an envelope shear force and considers various types of failure including plate buckling, flexural compression, shear force in the glue and in the MATboard of the bridge, etc. This code was used to build an 850 g bridge out of matboard that supported a live load of 1000 N (100 times greater than its self-weight).
